# 🏛️ Athens Analysis

**Athens Analysis** is a web application designed to assist with the **structural analysis of reinforced concrete beams**, with a focus on educational use by **Civil Engineering and Architecture students in Venezuela**.

---

## 🚀 About the Project

Athens Analysis aims to provide a lightweight, accessible tool for basic beam design and verification, following reinforced concrete principles. It offers immediate visual feedback and simplified input workflows to facilitate learning and productivity.

### ✨ Features

- Define beam dimensions and material properties
- Input and combine structural loads
- Visualize key properties and calculations in real-time
- Optimized for desktop usage

> ⚠️ The application is currently under development (MVP stage) — new features and improvements are on the way.
